# Purpose of the analysis

In this analysis, we use an [acute myeloid leukemia sample dataset](https://www.refine.bio/experiments/SRP070849) from [Shih et al., 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28193779/) pre-processed by [refinebio](https://www.refine.bio/). The dataset has 19 samples (obtained from 19 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model mice), containing RNA-sequencing results for types of AML under controlled treatment conditions.
